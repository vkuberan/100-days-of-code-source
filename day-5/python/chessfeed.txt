He was still within a point after 12 games, but that was basically the end of the good news for the youngster.

Eight players who worked with the late Russian grandmaster Yuri Razuvaev contested an online blitz (5'+3\") tournament: Ian Nepomniachtchi, Vladimir Kramnik, Evgeny Tomashevsky, Boris Gelfand, Joel Lautier, Alexander Motylev, Mikhail Kobalia, and Vladimir Potkin.</p>\n<p>It was a two stage event: first a round-robin, and then a two-game playoff between the top two finishers. You might expect that the first cycle would be a race between Kramnik and Nepomniachtchi, and you'd be right. What you might not expect is that theirs was a race for second, as Evgeny Tomashevsky won the round-robin portion with an undefeated 6/7. Kramnik and Nepo fought it out for second, and they finished tied with 5/7. Unfortunately for Nepomniachtchi, Kramnik went undefeated while Nepomniachtchi went \"undrawn\" - all seven of his games had a winner. From those two bits of information we know that Kramnik won their head-to-head game, and that was presumably the reason he was the official runner-up.</p>\n<p>Kramnik beat Tomashevsky in the first game of the final, and eked out a draw in game two to win the mini-match and the tournament. In a nice touch, the prize-winners donated their money to Razuvaev's widow - good for them, and for the organizers, who (I'm guessing) suggested this in advance.</p>\n<p>More on this, including games and video, <a href=\"https://www.chess.com/news/view/kramnik-wins-razuvaev-memorial-blitz\">here</a>.</p>"}, {"title": "Fedoseev Upsets Firouzja in a Razor-Close Match", "category": "2020 Chess.com Speed Chess Championship", "creator": "Dennis Monokroussos", "publishedDate": "Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:43:12 +0000", "link": "http://www.thechessmind.net/blog/2020/11/7/fedoseev-upsets-firouzja-in-a-razor-close-match.html", "description": "<p>I say \"upsets\" because Alireza Firouzja was the higher seed. But in this match, there was no indication that he was Vladimir Fedoseev's superior. Fedoseev led almost from start to finish, and it was only a near-epic collapse at the end of regulation that allowed Firouzja to force overtime. Fedoseev was up by two points with less than four minutes left, and could have played on in a queen vs. queen ending to run off at least another 30-60 seconds. Then he was winning the next game, but collapsed and wound up losing with just a few seconds left on the clock. That forced one last game, and there was no need for Fedoseev to lose that one either, but he did.</p>\n<p>To Fedoseev's great credit, he recovered. The overtime was a best-of-four at the 1'+1\" time control, and would have been followed by an Armageddon game, if necessary. The first game was drawn, and then Fedoseev won the second game. Firouzja continued to demonstrate his own resilience, striking back in game 3, but in the final game it was Fedoseev who had the last laugh, winning the match 15-14.
